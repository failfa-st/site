This Policy is designed to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
2016/679 ("GDPR"), and any other applicable data protection laws and regulations.

## 2. Data Processing by Third-Party Services

Our Services utilize third-party services provided by OpenAI, YouTube (a service provided by Google
LLC), and Vercel (a service provided by Vercel, Inc.). These third-party services may process your

We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of these third-party services

## 3. Local Storage of Non-Sensitive Information

Our Services store non-sensitive information in your browser's local storage. This information may
include user preferences, settings, or other data that enhances your experience on our website. The
information stored in local storage is not considered personal data under the GDPR, as it does not
allow us to identify you directly or indirectly.

## 4. Data Protection During Applications and the Application Process

We manage the personal information of job applicants to administer the application process. The
processing may take place electronically, especially when an applicant submits relevant application
materials electronically, such as through email or a website-based form. If we establish an
employment contract with an applicant, the provided data will be retained to manage the employment
relationship in adherence to legal regulations. If we do not form an employment contract with the
applicant, the application documents will be automatically removed four months after the rejection
notice, as long as no other legitimate interests of the controller oppose the deletion. Another
legitimate interest in this context could be, for example, the obligation to present evidence in
proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). The legal basis for processing personal
information of applicants is Section 26 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), in conjunction
with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b, 88 GDPR, and, if processing is conducted to fulfill legal requirements,
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. If the consent of the data subject serves as the basis for processing,
Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR is applied in conjunction with Section 26 BDSG.

The party responsible is not required to designate a corporate data protection officer according to
legal requirements. This privacy policy pertains to the websites where it is accessible. For our
other websites and services, the respective privacy policies apply.

## 5. Handling of your data

Various personal data are processed when you visit our website:

### Website provision and log file creation: Every time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the accessing device:

-   Browser type and version information
-   User's operating system
-   HTTP response code
-   Transferred byte count
-   User's IP address
-   Date and time of access
-   Websites from which the user's device navigates to our website
-   Websites accessed by the user's device through our website

Temporarily storing the IP address is necessary to enable the website's delivery to the user's
device. Consequently, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.

Log file storage serves the website's functionality. Additionally, this data helps us optimize our
online offerings and ensure the security of our IT systems. No evaluation of this data for marketing
purposes occurs in this context.

The data will be deleted once it is no longer needed to fulfill its intended purpose. In the case of
data collection for website provision, this occurs at the end of the usage process. In the case of
data storage in log files, deletion occurs no later than fourteen days. Storage beyond this period
is possible. In such cases, user IP addresses are either deleted or anonymized, making it impossible
to link them to the accessing client.

The legal basis for temporarily storing data and log files is Article 6 (1) f) of the European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our legitimate interest lies in the proper functioning of
this website, the evaluation of access information to eliminate and prevent technical issues, and
the prevention and tracking of security incidents.

In some instances, we use external service providers to process your data. We have carefully
selected and commissioned these providers, who are bound by our directives and are routinely
monitored. If our service providers or partners are located in a country outside the European
Economic Area (EEA), we will inform you of the implications of this situation in the offer
description.

### Cookies

This website employs cookies and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files stored on the
user's device by the internet browser. A cookie typically contains a unique sequence of characters
that allows the browser to be identified when revisiting the website. Cookies are utilized to make
the website more user-friendly, optimize its functions and services, and provide personalized
content.

The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to facilitate and streamline the use of the
website. Some features of this website cannot be provided without employing cookies.

User data collected via technically necessary cookies is not used to generate user profiles.
Additionally, with your separate consent, cookies may be used to provide external media such as
films and maps, as well as to analyze website usage.

The user data collected in this manner is pseudonymized using technical precautions. Thus, it is no
longer possible to link the data to the user accessing it. The data is not merged with other
personal data of the user.

By modifying the settings in your internet browser, you can disable or restrict the use of cookies.
Previously stored cookies can be deleted at any time. This process can also be automated. If cookies
are deactivated for the website, it may no longer be possible to fully utilize all the website's
features.

The legal basis for processing personal data using technically necessary cookies is Art. 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR. The controller's legitimate interest lies in the secure, stable, and efficient provision of
the website's functions and the information available through it. If the controller fulfills a
contractual obligation to you with the respective function

### External Links

Our website features links to third-party sites. The relevant privacy policies and data protection
information of the operators of these linked sites apply. We would like to emphasize that we are not
responsible for the data processing practices on third-party platforms beyond our control. This
particularly pertains to the processing of personal data by our subsidiaries and other affiliated
companies and their offered services.

### Inquiries/Transactions

Apart from the informational use of our offerings, you can submit questions or orders to us. To do
so, you will typically need to provide additional personal data, which we process to handle your
request, answer your inquiries, fulfill contracts with you, assert and realize our claims, and, if
necessary, respond to your evaluation. The aforementioned data processing principles apply to this
information. Furthermore, we use personal data when required to fulfill our legal obligations, such
as complying with documentation and storage obligations under tax or commercial law.

Data will only be shared with third parties if and to the extent necessary for fulfilling our
contractual obligations to you (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) GDPR) or if sharing your data is
necessary for the efficient processing of your request or answering your inquiry, as these
objectives constitute our legitimate interests under the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

The legal basis for processing your data is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR if consent has been granted. If
the processing serves the execution of a contract to which the data subject is a party or the
implementation of pre-contractual measures, the legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6
(1) (b) GDPR. If we process personal data to handle non-contract-related requests or inquiries or to
respond appropriately to evaluations, we do so for the purpose of optimal and efficient
communication with you, as well as appropriate evaluation and commenting on evaluations, and
improving our customer service, optimizing and tailoring our offerings, maintaining the customer
relationship, and resolving technical issues. These purposes constitute our legitimate interests
within the meaning of the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If we fulfill a legal
obligation by processing your personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR.

Additionally, we reserve the right to process personal data on a case-by-case basis if necessary,
for example, for the purpose of prosecuting abusive or fraudulent acts, for tracking and remedying
functional or security problems. The above purposes then constitute our legitimate interest within
the meaning of the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.

### Retention Period

**Unless stated otherwise in the respective individual information, we process personal data in
accordance with legal provisions only for the purposes outlined here in each case and only for as
long as personal identification of the data subject is required for the respective purpose.
Afterward, the data will be deleted or neutralized/anonymized in accordance with data protection.**

### SSL or TLS Encryption

Unencrypted data transmissions on the Internet (e.g., unencrypted communication by email) cannot
fully guarantee the confidentiality of the transmitted data. For security reasons and to protect the
transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries that you send to us as the site operator,
this site uses SSL or TLS encryption.

You can recognize an encrypted connection by the change in the browser's address line from "http://"
to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## 6. Your Rights

You have the right at any time to:

-   object to the processing of your data.
-   receive information about your data stored with us.
-   request that incorrect data about you be corrected by us.
-   request that data about you that is no longer needed be deleted from our system.
-   request that the processing of your data be restricted under certain conditions; this may apply,
    for example, if deletion is not possible but the data may not be further processed.
-   request the transfer of your data; this right particularly applies if you have given consent to
    the processing of your data or if the processing of the data is necessary to perform a contract.
    The right to data portability does not exist if your data is not processed automatically.

To exercise your rights, kindly reach out to us using the contact information given in the beginning
of this privacy policy.

If you feel that the processing of your data breaches legal norms, you have the option to lodge a
complaint with the relevant supervisory authority overseeing us.

Please note that in some instances, we may ask you for supplementary information to confirm your
identity. This measure helps us guarantee that sensitive information is not disclosed to
unauthorized parties.

changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Your continued use of the Services

## 8. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However,
no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot
guarantee the absolute security of your personal data.

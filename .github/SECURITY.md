## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, we kindly ask you to follow these steps:

1.  Visit our GitHub Issues page and create a new issue.
2.  Label the issue as "Security" and provide a clear, concise description of the vulnerability.
3.  Include any relevant details, such as steps to reproduce the vulnerability, potential impact,
    and suggested mitigations.

Upon receiving your report, our security team will review the information and investigate the
vulnerability. You can expect an initial response within 48 hours. Based on our findings, we will
either:

1.  Accept the vulnerability and work towards a resolution. We will keep you updated on our progress
    and notify you once a fix has been implemented and released.
2.  Decline the vulnerability if it is determined to be invalid or not applicable to our project. In
    this case, we will provide a thorough explanation for our decision.

We appreciate your contribution to improving the security of Fail4 and look forward to working
together to maintain a safe and secure environment for our users.
